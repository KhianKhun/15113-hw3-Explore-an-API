In development process, I used codex in coding and chatgpt plus to certain 
design direction and data processing. The prompts are Chinese in development.
The development total time is about 6-7 hours. 

1. I discuss the application ideas with AI, such that what type of things should 
I do, what API is suitable for this project.

2. After certain some directions, I search the relative API guideline and relative
application order.

3. I discuss the general apperance of the final project, including initial 
functions, the required package, UI and UX, the file structure of project, and 
some details

4. I open deep-thinking model, let Gpt give a very rough but runable code, and 
then I start debugging in Vs Code with codeX

5. The most important thing before working with codeX is confirm and confirm again
that the API application is work.

6. In codex, my main change is to advance UX and UI (not really, I only change the
forecast results into New Time Roman style) and complete various functions

7. The last step, I back to Gpt and let him provide a way to get US cities list and
their longitude and latitude to complete my project. After finding the dataset, 
I tell codeX "I only want the city with xxxx properties, give me the code"


Finally, I think that the meaingful prompts are content with ChatGpt certaining 
the project direction and file structure, since it tells AI a clear concepts and
direction. The debugging and achieve parts are responsible by codeX, I just 
describe what I want, it gives me complete codes, where it requires us an strong
ability to clear describe what we want but not an ambiguous prompt.

By the way, to achive the aligned report words, I designed an logic (perhaps) and
told to codeX, it worked and had a good performance.
